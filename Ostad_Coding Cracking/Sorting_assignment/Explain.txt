Task 01 :
********

Time Complexity:     O(n log n)
Space Complexity:   it does not require
                    additional strorage

Sorting methode:    Quick sort 
Explain :           This implementation solves the problems
                    efficiently in terms of both time and space,
                    meeting the problem constraints and ensuring 
                    optimal performance for large inputs.



Task 02 :
********

Time Complexity:    O(n + m), 
space Complexity:   O(n + m),
Sorting :           O((s1 + s2) log(s1 + s2));
